# Sample Preceptor/Learner Interaction Scenarios

Use these scenarios to test the feedback bot. Each scenario includes realistic context and specific observations that preceptors might provide.

## Scenario 1: Emergency Department - Strong Clinical Reasoning

**Student Name:** Sarah Chen  
**Setting:** Emergency Department, 4-week rotation  
**Clinical Context:** Busy urban ED, mix of acute and chronic presentations

**Key Observations:**
- Student worked up a 45-year-old presenting with chest pain
- Independently developed appropriate differential including cardiac, GI, and musculoskeletal causes
- Ordered initial workup (EKG, troponin, CXR) without prompting
- Presented case clearly with assessment and plan
- Followed up on labs and appropriately escalated when troponin was elevated
- Communicated well with patient about admission and testing rationale
- Struggled a bit with documentation speed - took 45 minutes to complete chart

**Strengths:** Clinical reasoning, patient communication, appropriate escalation  
**Growth Areas:** Efficiency in documentation, time management

## Scenario 2: Primary Care - Needs Improvement on Follow-Through

**Student Name:** Marcus Johnson  
**Setting:** Outpatient family medicine clinic, 6-week rotation  
**Clinical Context:** Community health center, predominantly underserved population

**Key Observations:**
- Saw patient with diabetes for routine follow-up
- Took thorough history and identified medication adherence issues
- During presentation, forgot to mention patient's elevated blood pressure (150/92)
- Required prompting to check HbA1c trend over past year
- Did not address overdue cancer screenings noted in chart
- Seemed to focus only on the chief complaint, missed opportunities for prevention
- When reminded, was receptive and went back to discuss screenings with patient
- Pleasant demeanor, patients seem comfortable with him

**Strengths:** Building rapport, receptiveness to feedback  
**Growth Areas:** Comprehensive chart review, preventive care integration, anticipatory thinking

## Scenario 3: Inpatient Medicine - Excellent Team Player

**Student Name:** Jennifer Wu  
**Setting:** General medicine floor, 8-week clerkship  
**Clinical Context:** Teaching hospital, interdisciplinary rounds

**Key Observations:**
- Followed 6 patients consistently throughout rotation
- Proactively coordinated with nursing, PT, and case management
- Noticed discrepancy in medication reconciliation and brought it to team's attention - prevented potential error
- Presentation style has improved dramatically - now includes relevant physical exam findings
- Asked thoughtful questions during rounds about antibiotic selection
- Stayed late to help admit a complex patient even though not assigned
- Sometimes hesitant to perform procedures independently - needs encouragement

**Strengths:** Teamwork, attention to detail, dedication, clinical growth  
**Growth Areas:** Confidence in procedural skills, assertiveness

## Scenario 4: Surgery - Struggling with Basic Knowledge

**Student Name:** David Park  
**Setting:** General surgery service, 4-week rotation  
**Clinical Context:** Tertiary care center, mostly elective cases with some trauma

**Key Observations:**
- Scrubbed in on laparoscopic cholecystectomy
- Could not identify common bile duct or cystic duct when asked
- Unfamiliar with basic anatomy of biliary tree despite upcoming surgery shelf exam
- Showed up late to pre-rounds twice (6:15 instead of 6:00 AM)
- During rounds, reading answers from phone rather than knowing patient details
- However, very eager in OR, asks good questions about technique
- Excellent with patient interactions on post-op checks - patients like him
- After direct conversation about expectations, has been on time and more prepared

**Strengths:** Patient rapport, responsiveness to feedback, enthusiasm in OR  
**Growth Areas:** Foundational knowledge, preparation, professionalism (punctuality)

## Scenario 5: Pediatrics - Solid All-Around Performance

**Student Name:** Amanda Rodriguez  
**Setting:** General pediatrics clinic, 4-week rotation  
**Clinical Context:** University-based pediatric primary care

**Key Observations:**
- Saw well-child visits and acute complaints
- Appropriately used CDC growth charts and developmental milestones
- Presentations are organized and complete
- Good at engaging with children - gets down to eye level, uses age-appropriate language
- Successfully calmed anxious 4-year-old before immunizations
- Asked about social determinants (food security, housing) without prompting
- Documentation is thorough and timely
- Could improve on efficiency - running 10-15 minutes behind by end of clinic
- Sometimes defers to preceptor when parent asks direct questions, even when she knows the answer

**Strengths:** Comprehensive assessments, rapport with children and families, thoroughness  
**Growth Areas:** Confidence in counseling families independently, time management

## Tips for Using These Scenarios

1. **Start with the student name** when the bot asks
2. **Describe the setting** (ED, clinic, inpatient, etc.)
3. **Share specific examples** rather than general impressions
4. **Include both strengths and areas for growth** for balanced feedback
5. **Mention patient interactions** when relevant
6. **Note any progression** or response to feedback during the rotation

You can modify these scenarios or mix elements from different ones to create variations for testing.
